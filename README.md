The Software Development Company requests you add user error exception handling capabilities to the C# program.

For this week’s assignment, build on the Week Three Individual Assignment, “Branching in C#,” by asking the user to record the software three developers’ information in a C# data structure object record. The C# data structure object record must include the type of employee as either W2 or 1099 using the following requirements:

The 1099 software development employees’ records do not include or calculate any taxesThe program properly handles and informs the user about errors on user inputThe program demonstrates in the code the use of references typesThe program displays on the console all the software developers’ data, monthly pay, monthly taxes, annual gross pay, annual taxes, and net pay

Using Visual Studio® and C# programming concepts, write a program to meet the specifications of the company’s request. The program should have the following characteristics:

Compile and Execute without errorsMeets specifications by displaying on the console a welcome message along with the following information on three software developers:Software developer nameAddressGross monthly payAnnual gross payEmployee type: W2/1099Monthly and annual taxes determined by employee typeLogic flow is clear, concise, and effective; demonstrates exception handling routines and reference types by catching and displaying user data entry errors and implementing reference types as part of the codeUser inputs and outputs should be clear on screenAppropriate indentation to logically illustrate program structureIdentifiers logically describe useNaming conventions are consistentComments and headers to explain processing that is not obvious

Zip your Visual Studio® solution project folder so it can be submitted for grading. In Visual Studio®, you can locate the folder with your solution by left clicking on the solution node in the Solution Explorer. Look at the Properties window to find the folder name in the Path property. Locate this folder in File Explorer and zip the folder.
